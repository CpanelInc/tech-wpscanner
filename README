WordPress Core Version: 6.4.3
[1]    ----------
   \_ CVE: CVE-2023-5692 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5692
       \_ [en] WordPress Core is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in versions up to, and including,  6.4.3 via the redirect_guess_404_permalink function. This can allow unauthenticated attackers to expose the slug of a custom post whose 'publicly_queryable' post status has been set to 'false'.
       \_ CWE: CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
       \_ The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.

[2]    ----------
   \_ CVE: CVE-2024-4439 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4439
       \_ [en] WordPress Core is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via user display names in the Avatar block in various versions up to 6.5.2 due to insufficient output escaping on the display name. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. In addition, it also makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that have the comment block present and display the comment author's avatar.
       \_ CWE: CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
       \_ The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.
